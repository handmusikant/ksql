# ![KSQL rocket](ksq-lrocket.png) KSQL - Streaming SQL for Apache Kafka



> *Important: This is a clone of the KSQL project to demonstrate how to built a User-Defined Function (UDF). The projects adds a H2O Deep Learning model. That's it.*

For the most up-to-date version, documentation and examples of KSQL, please go to [Confluent's official KSQL Github repository](https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql).

# Use Case: Continuous Health Checks with Anomaly Detection
The following example leverages a pre-trained analytic model within a KSQL UDF for continuous stream processing in real time to do health checks and alerting in case of risk. The Kafka ecosystem is used for inference, monitoring and alerting

# Deep Learning with an H2O Autoencoder for Sensor Analytics
Each row (i.e. message input from the sensor to Kafka) represents a single heartbeat and contains over 200 columns with numbers. 

The [User-Defined KSQL Function ‘AnomalyKudf’ applies an H2O Neural Network](https://github.com/kaiwaehner/ksql/blob/4.0.x/ksql-engine/src/main/java/io/confluent/ksql/function/udf/ml/AnomalyKudf.java). The class creates a new object instance of the Deep Learning model and applies it to the incoming sensor messages for detection of anomalies. 

# Quick Start for KSQL Machine Learning UDF
How to test this implementation?

The analytic model and its dependency is already included in this project. You just have to start Kafka and the KSQL engine to send input streams for inference. Here are the steps:

confluent start kafka
 
./bin/ksql local

kafka-topics \
--zookeeper localhost:2181 \
--create \
--topic HealthSensorInputTopic \
--partitions 1 \
--replication-factor 1
